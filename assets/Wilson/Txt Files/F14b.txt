You asked me to not write in acknowledgement of your letter after we talked on the phone. But I want only to record my gratitude for your candor and your deeply felt experience. My paper, written in late October, was meant as an exercise for me to discover what I had observed, been told, and thought about since coming into residence. It was also meant to stimulate more experienced others to react upon the intangibles which would be put at jeopardy were we to alter our form. The rich harvest of thoughtful responses I have received will prove invaluable, though we both know that they mainly come don on the side favoring policy change. 

In all events, know how much I prize having your letter and your association. I pray the matter will, in due course, be settled in a way which will prove to be strengthening.
