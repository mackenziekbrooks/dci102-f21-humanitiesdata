I want to thank you most sincerely for replying so thoughtfully to my memo on the question of coeducation in the undergraduate program here. Your sense of the matter will be very useful in helping me to my final recommendation to the Board and to the Board's assessment of the important policy question now before it. Thank you very much indeed.

Your reminder that pouring money on the demographic problem will not address the fundamental issues is well worth having. I like also your reminder that our uniqueness cannot be so fragile as is commonly supposed. Thanks for making your points so well.
