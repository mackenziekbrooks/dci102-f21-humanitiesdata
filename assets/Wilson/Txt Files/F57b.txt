I want to thank you most sincerely for replying so thoughtfully to my memo on the question of coeducation in the undergraduate program here. Your sense of the matter will be very useful in helping me to my final recommendation to the Board and to the Board's assessment of the important policy question now before it. Thank you very much indeed.

I share your hope that we might deï¬‚ate this issue somewhat. I'm afraid it threatens to become a debilitating preoccupation. Do whatever you can and I will too.
