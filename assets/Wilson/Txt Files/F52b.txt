I want to thank you most sincerely for replying so thoughtfully to my memo on the question of coeducation in the undergraduate program here. Your sense of the matter will be very useful in helping me to my final recommendation to the Board and to the Board's assessment of the important policy question now before it. Thank you very much indeed.

The cultivation, however inadvertent, of male chauvinist views and attitudes is distressing. Your perception of this phenomenon is important for me to have. I haven't the
experience here to see this clearly for myself.

Every best wish.
