I want to thank you most sincerely for replying so thoughtfully to my memo on the question of coeducation in the undergraduate program here. Your sense of the matter will be very useful in helping me to my final recommendation to the Board and to the Board's assessment of the important policy question now before it. Thank you very much indeed.

I think you are right in reminding us that issues of this Sort are rarely "do or die" issues and I regret any contribution I might have made to strengthen that impression. The real problem is trying to predict the general shape of an uncertain future. I confess I am not very good at prophecy, but we will try to find out as much as we can and make intelligent judgments after that has been done.
