I want to thank you most sincerely for replying so thoughtfully to my memo on the question of coeducation in the undergraduate program here. Your sense of the matter will be very useful in helping me to my final recommendation to the Board and to the Board's assessment of the important policy question now before it. Thank you very much indeed.

I think the example you shared with me is especially telling. I think many of us carry baggage about with us which we hardly know is there. Sexual and racial stereotyping contribute much too much of this luggage. Thanks for telling me about one student's discovery.
