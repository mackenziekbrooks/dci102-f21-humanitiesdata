I want to thank you most sincerely for replying so thoughtfully to my memo on the question of coeducation in the undergraduate program here. Your sense of the matter will be very useful in helping me to my final recommendation to the Board and to the Board's assessment of the important policy question now before it. Thank you very much indeed.

Your provocative questions are well worth contemplating and I thank you for putting the matter as you have. I am intrigued by the identity question and the indictment of our efforts to live up to the standards we so easily talk about. I guess you are saying that we ought to restore the code of the gentleman if we can before we put it finally out of reach.

At any rate, Harold, I thank you for setting the matter out in the cogent manner of your letter.
