I want to thank you most sincerely for replying so thoughtfully to my memo on the question of coeducation in the undergraduate program here. Your sense of the matter will be very useful in helping me to my final recommendation to the Board and to the Board's assessment of the important policy question now before it. Thank you very much indeed.

Your sense of our "civilized reticences" and manners is most compelling. I agree, now that you have phrased the matter so clearly, that these have much to do with our distinction and our academic quality. I do hope, however the Board decides, that we can reinstitute civility in all phases of our community life. 

Thanks, John, for your beautifully written letter.
