I want to thank you most sincerely for replying so thoughtfully to my memo on the question of coeducation in the undergraduate program here. Your sense of the matter will be very useful in helping me to my final recommendation to the Board and to the Board's assessment of the important policy question now before it. Thank you very much indeed.

I especially value your comments about our homogeneous student body and the impact this has on the quality and range of our formal and informal conversations. I think you may well be right about this.

Thanks, Jack, for deciding to write.
