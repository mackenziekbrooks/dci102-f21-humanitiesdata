I want to thank you most sincerely for replying so thoughtfully to my memo on the question of coeducation in the undergraduate program here. Your sense of the matter will be very useful in helping me to my final recommendation to the Board and to the Board's assessment of the important policy question now before it. Thank you very much indeed.

My rough numbers and ratios are not well thought through. In fact I posited 1000 men so we might keep the argument on the main question and not be debating about fraternity reform or athletic commitments. I fear we could be badly side—tracked by those who have primary commitments to these ancillary activities. Anyway, we‘ll have to look at this matter more carefully as the years unfold (assuming we start down this other path).

Thanks again for your letter. I'm distressed at your account of declining competence. It is not your view alone and I fear its continuation.
