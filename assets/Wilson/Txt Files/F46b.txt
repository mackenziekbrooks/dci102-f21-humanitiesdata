I want to thank you most sincerely for replying so thoughtfully to my memo on the question of coeducation in the undergraduate program here. Your sense of the matter will be very useful in helping me to my final recommendation to the Board and to the Board's assessment of the important policy question now before it. Thank you very much indeed.

I'm especially glad to have a concrete example of the effects of sexual-segregation in the classroom. I'm not sure I noticed this in reverse at Wells. I should have, no doubt, and just may not have had my antennae out at critical times.
