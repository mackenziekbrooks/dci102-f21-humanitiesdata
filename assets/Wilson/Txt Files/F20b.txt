I want to thank you most sincerely for replying so thoughtfully to my memo on the question of coeducation in the undergraduate program here. Your sense of the matter will be very useful in helping me to my final recommendation to the Board and to the Board's assessment of the important policy question now before it. Thank you very much indeed.

I agree that size is a crucial factor to take into account. We cannot permit a "disfiguring" increase under any circumstances. Davidson has maintained a 9/5 ratio and so has Princeton. I don't think there are legal problems in doing so. But clearly there will be internal pressures, especially if the women applicants are much stronger. We must be very thoughtful about this size business if the Board decides to go forward.

Thanks, Lamar, for your helpful counsel.
