I want to thank you most sincerely for replying so thoughtfully to my memo on the question of coeducation in the undergraduate program here. Your sense of the matter will be very useful in helping me to my final recommendation to the Board and to the Board's assessment of the important policy question now before it. Thank you very much indeed.

You are quite right about civility and mutual respect. Anne hasn't been here very long, but she has often remarked about the manners of our students. I do hope, whatever we do, that this important part of our lives is kept strong.

By the way, I know nothing about the Princeton divorce study. If you could get a copy, whatever its value, I would be glad to see what it says. That picture is so dim in America that I'm not sure we could trust the conclusions. Still, I'd like to see what is proposed.

Thanks, Ed, for your marginal comments and questions. They will prove very useful.
