I want to thank you most sincerely for replying so thoughtfully to my memo on the question of coeducation in the undergraduate program here. Your sense of the matter will be very useful in helping me to my final recommendation to the Board and to the Board's assessment of the important policy question now before it. Thank you very much indeed.

I'm glad to be reminded of your earlier references in the five-year report last spring. I must reread all of the reports from this perspective, for I was looking for other things in the spring. Your comments on student attitudes are also apt and I'm glad to have them. Student reaction was disconcertingly more shrill than I expected.

Thanks, Cleve.
