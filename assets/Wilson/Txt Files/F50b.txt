I want to thank you most sincerely for replying so thoughtfully to my memo on the question of coeducation in the undergraduate program here. Your sense of the matter will be very useful in helping me to my final recommendation to the Board and to the Board's assessment of the important policy question now before it. Thank you very much indeed.

Your sense of the feeling of "alienation" when one's Alma Mater is altered is very real to me. I suspect we would have to try to anticipate this in some sensible way and work to overcome it. Our alumni are too important to us to become "strangers."

Thanks, Emory, for your thoughtful letter.
