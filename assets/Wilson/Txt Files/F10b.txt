I want to thank you most sincerely for replying so thoughtfully to my memo on the question of coeducation in the undergraduate program here. Your sense of the matter will be very useful in helping me to my final recommendation to the Board and to the Board's assessment of the important policy question now before it. Thank you very much indeed.

Bill, we will have to talk at great length about the implications, some of which you clearly envisage. I do not wish to underestimate the impact upon the program. But I think it would also be wrong to posit the need for vast expenditures. Title IX has been useful everywhere as a whipping boy. Let's see, if we decide to admit women, if we cannot shape a sterling program for both and to involve everyone now on staff in achieving that end.

The key point is to keep our ability to choose alive. Then we can decide whom we will choose to come, that is, what talents we will want to see represented in the class. How Davidson, with 900 men, or Hampdenâ€”Sydney, with 700, can compete as they do is something you and your colleagues must answer before predictions of athletic mediocrity, or worse, are voiced. A far worse fate for Washington and Lee would be to lose entirely its
ability to choose and to accept every man who applies and still fall short of our current size.

We'll talk more about this, quite obviously. In the meantime, my thanks for your leadership and the pleasure of working with a man of integrity.
