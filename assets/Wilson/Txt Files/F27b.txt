I want to thank you most sincerely for replying so thoughtfully to my memo on the question of coeducation in the undergraduate program here. Your sense of the matter will be very useful in helping me to my final recommendation to the Board and to the Board's assessment of the important policy question now before it. Thank you very much indeed.

Thanks, especially, for sharing your Kenyon experience with me. I hadn‘t realized you were a member of the first ”coeducation class." It must have been a very good one! 

If the matter becomes relevant later on, I will want to talk with you about the Kenyon transition; I think there may be dozens of things we could learn--things we should do or should cease doing to insure a favorable transition. But it may be premature to take this up now.

I would appreciate having from you any alumni magazine articles on the success of Kenyon's decision. That could help very much.
