Your special perspective on the coeducation question is valuable to me to have and I know it will be for the Board as well. Thank you very much for writing; I have been able to include your letter in the file I am taking to Philadelphia tomorrow (Sunday) to share with the Rector.

I spoke with Henry Sharp yesterday and will find a time to tell you about it. Anyway he knows I've asked you to place the curriculum in the Committee's hands without prejudice to the organizational question. Every best wish; the University continues in your debt.
