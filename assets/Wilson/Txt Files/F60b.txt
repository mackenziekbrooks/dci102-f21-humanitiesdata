Thank you for yours of 26 October. I'm glad to have it freshly stated. I suspect by now you will have received my own long memorandum on the subject. I will let your note stand as your response to my call for individual faculty assessments unless you feel compelled to comment on one or another point I raised in my paper. 

The feelings are very high, higher than I had thought they might be. I'm especially surprised by the strength of the negative on the students' side. I suspect most of the others are lying low, at least for the moment.

Every day brings me a fresh harvest of notes from alumni who tell me  I am bent upon "wreckingâ€œ or "destroying" their University. I find it so hard to understand this sort of mind. I think it may mean that we do not always succeed in our hopes for liberal education.

Your good letter, as well you can imagine, was warmly welcomed.
