I want to thank you most sincerely for replying so thoughtfully to my memo on the question of coeducation in the undergraduate program here. Your sense of the matter will be very useful in helping me to my final recommendation to the Board and to the Board's assessment of the important policy question now before it. Thank you very much indeed.

Your perspective from the Golden Dome is most useful, Tom. I've not heard very much about the effects of the transition in South Bend. If they have a tenâ€”year report, or whatever, I know it would be good to have on hand. Let me know if you've seen anything in recent alumni magazines.

Every best wish. I'm so very pleased you are here.
