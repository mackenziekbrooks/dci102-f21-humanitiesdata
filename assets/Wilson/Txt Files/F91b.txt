I have your letter providing the Law School's perspective on the issue of coeducation and thank you for it. It sets out some notions, as did Ned Henneman's letter, that I hadn't thought very much about. When I sent to the trustees a folder of all the faculty letters I have received, I did call special attention to Ned's concern about recruitment. I will see that the trustees have your letter as well. The Honor System implication is deeply unfortunate and must not be further aggravated. I do hope our meeting with Bob Jenevein will prove useful. It is just plain wrong to suggest that the presence of women would weaken the Honor System. Loyalties, apart from romantic ones, are many and place potential impediments to the proper functioning of the System. I hope the women Law School students have not heard very much about E.C. suspicions on this narrow and unwarranted ground.

Thanks for expressing your view, Rick. I did not ask for administrative response, as you know, but the Law School perspective is very important and I welcome the chance to share it with the Board.
