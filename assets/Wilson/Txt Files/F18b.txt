I want to thank you most sincerely for replying so thoughtfully to my memo on the question of coeducation in the undergraduate program here. Your sense of the matter will be very useful in helping me to my final recommendation to the Board and to the Board's assessment of the important policy question now before it. Thank you very much indeed.

I hadn't noticed the reference in the Guide to Davidson men and the fear they have of smart women. I guess women have always had to put up with our insecurities in this business. I remember a women on the VPI faculty who enjoyed beating me in tennis. I didn't enjoy it as much, but then, I don't like losing to men either.

Every best wish. Thanks again for writing so well on this thorny subject.
