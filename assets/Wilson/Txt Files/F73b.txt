I want to thank you most sincerely for replying so thoughtfully to my memo on the question of coeducation in the undergraduate program here. Your sense of the matter will be very useful in helping me to my final recommendation to the Board and to the Board's assessment of the important policy question now before it. Thank you very much indeed.

I'm glad, too, to have your perspective on our arcane fraternity system. I'm not sure that coeducation would fix this system, but it would change the conditions of life here sufficiently to make the fraternities respond positively or wither on the vine.

Every best wish, Fred.
