I want to thank you most sincerely for replying so thoughtfully to my memo on the question of coeducation in the undergraduate program here. Your sense of the matter will be very useful in helping me to my final recommendation to the Board and to the Board's assessment of the important policy question now before it. Thank you very much indeed.

Your sense of what truly set us off as an institution is important to me to have. I believe the argument that our gender makes us unique is not accurate, but it is frequently used.

My best wishes, Leonard, accompany this note.
