I want to thank you most sincerely for replying so thoughtfully to my memo on the question of coeducation in the undergraduate program here. Your sense of the matter will be very useful in helping me to my final recommendation to the Board and to the Board's assessment of the important policy question now before it. Thank you very much indeed.

I think your point about size and ratios is a good one. By positing 1000 men, yet keeping the place small, I was trying to avoid arguing about the wrong things (e.g. what will happen to fraternities and/or sports). The ratio, after the first ten years or so, could obviously be re-examined. I doubt we could manage much more quickly than that anyway.

But I'm getting well ahead of myself. Thanks again for your good letter. We'll try to get VMI and Sweet Briar together!
