 
I want to thank you most sincerely for replying so thoughtfully to my memo on the question of coeducation in the undergraduate program here. Your sense of the matter will be very useful in helping me to my final recommendation to the Board and to the Board's assessment of the important policy question now before it. Thank you very much indeed.

Your "down home" saying has been expressed by many others. It reminds me of the Fram advertisement, "Pay me now or pay me later." In other words, the real trick will be to find out when we are headed for a state of brokenness so that it can be prevented, rather than "fixed." I don't pretend to know how to do that in any exact way.

Thanks for your thoughtful letter.
