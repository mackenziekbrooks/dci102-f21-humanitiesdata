I want to thank you most sincerely for replying so thoughtfully to my memo on the question of coeducation in the undergraduate program here. Your sense of the matter will be very useful in helping me to my final recommendation to the Board and to the Board's assessment of the important policy question now before it. Thank you very much indeed.

I haven't really thought about ratios in any serious way. By setting out a hypothetical set of numbers I was trying to shift the argument to the right subject. Still, it would have to be carefully thought through, should the Board decide to change our policy.
