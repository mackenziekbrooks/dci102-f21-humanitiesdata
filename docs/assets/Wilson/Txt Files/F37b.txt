I want to thank you most sincerely for replying so thoughtfully to my memo on the question of coeducation in the undergraduate program here. Your sense of the matter will be very useful in helping me to my final recommendation to the Board and to the Board's assessment of the important policy question now before it. Thank you very much indeed.

Your sense of what women might contribute to the aesthetic values of our community is important to me to have. I think you are right about this, assuming the right women would choose to come. I suppose that is key to almost everything.

At any rate, Al, thanks for your thoughtful reply.
