I want to thank you most sincerely for replying so thoughtfully to my memo on the question of coeducation in the undergraduate program here. Your sense of the matter will be very useful in helping me to my final recommendation to the Board and to the Board's assessment of the important policy question now before it. Thank you very much indeed.

I did not mean to imply, by the way, that I believe an allâ€”male glee club is a bad idea. I really meant to suggest only that you and Al Gordon would be better served if you didn't have to depend upon the high school girls to supplement your ranks when the program calls for female voices or parts. I share your hope that our singing traditions could and should be kept strong.

Every best wish.
