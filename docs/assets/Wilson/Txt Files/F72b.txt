I want to thank you most sincerely for replying so thoughtfully to my memo on the question of coeducation in the undergraduate program here. Your sense of the matter will be very useful in helping me to my final recommendation to the Board and to the Board's assessment of the important policy question now before it. Thank you very much indeed.

I didn't know about women students in Graham's class. In fact many of your observations; Taylor, are new to me and all the more valuable to me for being so. I'm especially intrigued by the linking up of coeducation and a more firmly-established residential community. I think the link may be there, even as another one can be attached to the fraternities. But the idea of trying to construct a cozy mid-western environment (whatever that might be--Oberlin?) couldn't be further from my mind. I am persuaded that the long tradition of student autonomy was accompanied by a willingness of the faculty and administration to point out when the "code" was abridged. And this runs from Lee to Gilliam, I dare say, with few breaks. Still, we both know a "tradition" in college need be no older than one student generation.

Thanks so much for your interesting letter. It has permitted me to see that I have created a union of opponents (autonomy-advocates, fraternity guys and those who don't want women here full-time)--more's the pity.
