I want to thank you most sincerely for replying so thoughtfully to my memo on the question of coeducation in the undergraduate program here. Your sense of the matter will be very useful in helping me to my final recommendation to the Board and to the Board's assessment of the important policy question now before it. Thank you very much indeed.

Your sense of the "yield" problem is most telling. We think we know why they choose to go elsewhere, but interviews would tell more than questionnaires. Maybe we should involve our alumni admissions people in the effort.

Thanks so much for writing.
