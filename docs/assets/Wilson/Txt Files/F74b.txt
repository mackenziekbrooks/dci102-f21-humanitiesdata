I want to thank you most sincerely for replying so thoughtfully to my memo on the question of coeducation in the undergraduate program here. Your sense of the matter will be very useful in helping me to my final recommendation to the Board and to the Board's assessment of the important policy question now before it. Thank you very much indeed.

I found especially helpful your thoughts about homogeneity and community. I think the argument for the status quo will finally settle upon this point and your notion of the "trade-off" is useful, with diversity carrying its own strong weight.

I'm not sure how to deal with the athletic part of the question. I've asked the Committee to do a sober assessment of the implications and I've asked Coach McHenry to eschew large
adjectives for a while--as in "enormous costs," "tremendous shifts," "devastating effects" etc. I think the problem of who will change in which locker room can be sorted out by reasonable people if it comes to that.

Your many contributions here are deeply appreciated. Your thoughtful letter is only the most recent cause of the gratitude I feel.
