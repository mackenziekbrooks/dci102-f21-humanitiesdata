Let me just say in writing what I said the other day. Your letter on coeducation is very hard-hitting. I haven't had the same experience with our students, for we don't often come together over subjects which would reveal this element of selfishness. I share your view that we are lost as a society if these attitudes continue to grow.

Best to you at this holiday season.
