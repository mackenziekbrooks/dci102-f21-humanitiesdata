I want to thank you most sincerely for replying so thoughtfully to my memo on the question of coeducation in the undergraduate program here. Your sense of the matter will be very useful in helping me to my final recommendation to the Board and to the Board's assessment of the important policy question now before it. Thank you very much indeed.

You raise many interesting questions, Ron, some of which I've not begun to consider. I think I've pushed sororities quite out of my mind! I hope they will stay there, but one can't count on it, I'm sure. 

Anyway, thanks so much for your thoughtful letter.
