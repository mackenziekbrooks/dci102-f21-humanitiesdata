I want to thank you most sincerely for replying so thoughtfully to my memo on the question of coeducation in the undergraduate program here. Your sense of the matter will be very useful in helping me to my final recommendation to the Board and to the Board's assessment of the important policy question now before it. Thank you very much indeed.

I especially appreciate having those of your views which take us beyond the enrollment prospect. I very much agree that our social life would likely develop new forms and I really believe these could be healthy and happy forms.

Thanks, Ann, for taking time to write.
