I want to thank you most sincerely for replying so thoughtfully to my memo on the question of coeducation in the undergraduate program here. Your sense of the matter will be very useful in helping me to my final recommendation to the Board and to the Board's assessment of the important policy question now before it. Thank you very much indeed.

I'm intrigued to learn about the changes in the broadcast and print journalism fields. I guess I had thought that change there, except for the showpiece women on the major news
programs, had somehow been a bit retarded. Thanks for correcting that view.
