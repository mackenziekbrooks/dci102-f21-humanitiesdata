Your good letter is most warmly welcomed; it arrives on the very day that I am packing up my file to travel to Philadelphia for a visit with the Rector. I am so pleased to be able to include it.

The contrast between a club and a community is most instructive. No one has quite put it this way before and I am glad to have your unique lenses to look through. 

Thank you, Lash, for your help in this most delicate and important matter.
