I want to thank you most sincerely for replying so thoughtfully to my memo on the question of coeducation in the undergraduate program here. Your sense of the matter will be very useful in helping me to my final recommendation to the Board and to the Board's assessment of the important policy question now before it. Thank you very much indeed.

Your account of declining student ability is persuasive, George. and unsettling. You are not alone in making the observation, but your testimony is very compelling. I'm sure it will be of interest to the Board.

Thanks so much for writing.
