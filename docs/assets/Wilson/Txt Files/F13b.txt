I want to thank you most sincerely for replying so thoughtfully to my memo on the question of coeducation in the undergraduate program here. Your sense of the matter will be very useful in helping me to my final recommendation to the Board and to the Board's assessment of the important policy question now before it. Thank you very much indeed.

I'm intrigued by your recollections of the fraternity fear of the dining hall. That helps me some to see the current concern in clearer perspective.

Taken together, Edgar, your many wellâ€”reasoned points are most useful to me. They are sober and solid, just as I knew they would be. I am very pleased to have your letter.
