Your letter is not too late and has proven very useful to me. I am very grateful to have your perspective. I clearly see the point re the social problems, course and others like it. This point of view very much needs to be heard and I will do my best to see to it that your letter is placed, with others; before the Board.

Every best wish. I do look forward to an early chance to come to know you better.
