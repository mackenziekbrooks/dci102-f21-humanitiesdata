I want to thank you most sincerely for replying so thoughtfully to my memo on the question of coeducation in the undergraduate program here. Your sense of the matter will be very useful in helping me to my final recommendation to the Board and to the Board's assessment of the important policy question now before it. Thank you very much indeed.

Your personal sense of the implications of quality decline is very important for me to have, and to be able to share with others. I will not share them with the folks next door, but I know what you are talking about from the testimony of a few others who have had similar experience.

All best wishes, John.
