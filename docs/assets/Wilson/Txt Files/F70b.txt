I want to thank you most sincerely for replying so thoughtfully to my memo on the question of coeducation in the undergraduate program here. Your sense of the matter will be very useful in helping me to my final recommendation to the Board and to the Board's assessment of the important policy question now before it. Thank you very much indeed.

I am especially glad to be reminded of the earlier citation of your view in the five-year report of last spring. I must review all of these reports for what they might offer on this subject. I had frankly not initially read them in that context.

Your kind regard for my continuing work here is especially appreciated. I am, of course, deeply mindful of the potentially debilitating controversy this issue may cause and the consequences it could have for me and my family. But I will try to keep my perspective on this part of the problem. It is far more important that we do what finally will prove to be best for Washington and Lee.
