I want to thank you most sincerely for replying so thoughtfully to my memo on the question of coeducation in the undergraduate program here. Your sense of the matter will be very useful in helping me to my final recommendation to the Board and to the Board's assessment of the important policy question now before it. Thank you very much indeed.

I'm glad to be reminded of the earlier students from the Far East. Actually I was trying to make a point about what I took to be the profound and irreversible: movement of women toward freedom from pre-conceived roles, even in the most traditional and restrictive societies.

While I'm about it, I should also say that I didn't mean that women could not do mathematics as well as men. This may turn out to be true for various reasons, but the only point I meant to make was that, in quantitative fields masculine and feminine views are probably irrelevant, as they are probably not in the social sciences and humanities. I must try to sharpen this observation if I redo the paper for another audience.
