I want to thank you most sincerely for replying so thoughtfully to my memo on the question of coeducation in the undergraduate program here. Your sense of the matter will be very useful in helping me to my final recommendation to the Board and to the Board's assessment of the important policy question now before it. Thank you very much indeed.

I profited from your juxtaposition of declining demand and changing preferences. I believe you are correct in calculating both parts of that unattractive equation. One can't measure the rate of preferenceâ€”change but it must greatly exaggerate the overall effects of population decline.

Thanks for sharing your views with me. The Board will find them helpful. I'm sure.
