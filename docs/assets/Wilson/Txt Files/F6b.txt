Your letter reaches me on Saturday morning just before I leave to speak to the parents. I am going to read from it to them, so exquisitely reasoned and expressed is it. It gives me a pleasure I simply must share with others, even though I will not identify its author -- not without your permission.

The pleasure I feel is of the discovery of yet a new level of thought and sentiment I am privileged to share in as a member of this Faculty. You have made me see the matter in a strikingly apt way, one I couldn't have come upon without your heIp.

It is quite the best explication of the connections between values, institutions and the larger culture I have read in such concise and elegant form.

My thanks go out to you for taking the time to help me in this marvelously illuminating way.
