Your letter to the trustees is wonderfully apt and therefore deeply appreciated. I especially am grateful for your larger perspective (they do believe, some of them, that I invented the subject) and for your incisive reminder that the issue has never been truly "decided," but merely postponed. It will have a good effect and I am glad you decided to write and to write apart from the general lot of letters. It will be read and I deeply hope will have a favorable effect.
