I want to thank you most sincerely for replying so thoughtfully to my memo on the question of coeducation in the undergraduate program here. Your sense of the matter will be very useful in helping me to my final recommendation to the Board and to the Board's assessment of the important policy question now before it. Thank you very much indeed.

Thanks, especially, for your observations on the VMI experience. I haven't followed what has happened over there for the past 10â€”15 years. Maybe I should try to get Jim Morgan to
chart the decline in quality of the students they attract. Of course, W&L alums would not concede the analogy anyway.Still, it would be worth knowing.

Every best wish.
