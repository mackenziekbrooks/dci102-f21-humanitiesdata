I want to thank you most sincerely for replying so thoughtfully to my memo on the question of coeducation in the undergraduate program here. Your sense of the matter will be very useful in helping me to my final recommendation to the Board and to the Board's assessment of the important policy question now before it. Thank you very much indeed.

I fully share your sense of the confusion between statistical and social significance. I swear, though, I can't get alumni to see that gender did not set us off for our first two centuries and more. I'll keep trying and your letter will help me very much.

Thanks for writingâ€”-and for supervising Bowen's study. Do you have more of his "summaries"? I think I'll need to send a copy to each member of the Board so that the current frenzy can be kept in perspective.
