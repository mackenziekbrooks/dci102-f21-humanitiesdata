I want to thank you most sincerely for replying so thoughtfully to my memo on the question of coeducation in the undergraduate program here. Your sense of the matter will be very useful in helping me to my final recommendation to the Board and to the Board's assessment of the important policy question now before it. Thank you very much indeed.

Your linking up the experiences you have had at Lehigh and Yale is helpful to me. I'm very glad to have your letter and to be in position to share it with the Board.
