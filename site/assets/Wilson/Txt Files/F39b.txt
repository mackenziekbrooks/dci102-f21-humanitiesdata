I want to thank you most sincerely for replying so thoughtfully to my memo on the question of coeducation in the undergraduate program here. Your sense of the matter will be very useful in helping me to my final recommendation to the Board and to the Board's assessment of the important policy question now before it. Thank you very much indeed.

I very much appreciate your wise counsel, Ed. It is a big step and shouldn't be taken lightly. Im sure the Board will be ever so careful in its assessment and will find your letter to be helpful in the process.
