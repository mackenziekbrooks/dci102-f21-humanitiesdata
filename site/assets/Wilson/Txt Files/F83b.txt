Thanks to your good note on coeducation and what, in your view, it means to Washington and Lee. The special perspective of your long and successful service here as Dean of the College will be of great assistance to the Board. 

I am pleased that you decided to anticipate your return to the Faculty by commenting on the quality issue. It is a crucial issue in the entire discussion and your perspective is uniquely valuable for us to have on hand.

Every best wish.
