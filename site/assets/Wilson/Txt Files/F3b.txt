I want to thank you most sincerely for replying so thoughtfully to my memo on the question of coeducation in the undergraduate program here. Your sense of the matter will be very useful in helping me to my final recommendation to the Board and to the Board's assessment of the important policy question now before it. Thank you very much indeed.

The mid-term experience you report is disturbing. I believe others have had the same experience. Bill Watt tells me the grades are alarmingly low. I'll have to remember "drawing from a short deck." It is the best way I have heard for describing what I dread we might be in for.
