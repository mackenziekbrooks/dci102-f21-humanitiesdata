I want to thank you most sincerely for replying so thoughtfully to my memo on the question of coeducation in the undergraduate program here. Your sense of the matter will be very useful in helping me to my final recommendation to the Board and to the Board's assessment of the important policy question now before it. Thank you very much indeed.

I'm especially glad to have the Wabash/forensic perspective on this question. I hadn't kept up with the movement of women into speech teaching and forensic participation. It is very helpful to have your experience to share with others on this front.

Every best wish.
