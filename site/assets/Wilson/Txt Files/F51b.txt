I want to thank you most sincerely for replying so thoughtfully to my memo on the question of coeducation in the undergraduate program here. Your sense of the matter will be very useful in helping me to my final recommendation to the Board and to the Board's assessment of the important policy question now before it. Thank you very much indeed.

You have expressed the special quality of Washington and Lee most movingly. I too am unsure of how much of it is traceable to our allâ€”male character. That is the bedeviling part of the entire problem.

In any event I'm glad to have your letter and to be able to share it with the Board.
