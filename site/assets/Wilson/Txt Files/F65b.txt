I want to thank you most sincerely for replying so thoughtfully to my memo on the question of coeducation in the undergraduate program here. Your sense of the matter will be very useful in helping me to my final recommendation to the Board and to the Board's assessment of the important policy question now before it. Thank you very much indeed.

I appreciate your strong moral argument, especially your having put our own policy against those of other all-male colleges which have changed. I think that is a telling point and I am glad you thought to make it.

Every best wish.
