Your letter is everything I knew it would be. It succeeds in taking the issue from its narrow frame and enlarging it over time and across parochial lines of interest. It pays proper attention to the history and character of Washington and Lee and yet demands that we see these in the larger perspective of university work in the service of an evolving
society. And, most importantly for me, it warns that the decision to admit women would only be the starting point of hard work and careful thought to insure that women could, indeed, become part of the University - and not merely tenuously grafted, foreign appendages.

I am really most grateful. You have helped to provide a framework we very much need to see this matter clearly. I know I speak for the Board when I express my gratitude for the time and thought you have invested in our effort to insure a serious examination of this question.
