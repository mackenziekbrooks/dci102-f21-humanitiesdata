I want to thank you most sincerely for replying so thoughtfully to my memo on the question of coeducation in the undergraduate program here. Your sense of the matter will be very useful in helping me to my final recommendation to the Board and to the Board's assessment of the important policy question now before it. Thank you very much indeed.

I'm also glad to be reminded of the Matrazzo column in the Ring Tum Phi. I read that column with considerable interest. It is also very useful to have your recollections of life at Southwestern. I visited there last fall and found it most attractive.

Thank you very much, David, for your thoughtful letter.
