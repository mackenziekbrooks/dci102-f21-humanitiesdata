I want to thank you most sincerely for replying so thoughtfully to my memo on the question of coeducation in the undergraduate program here. Your sense of the matter will be very useful in helping me to my final recommendation to the Board and to the Board's assessment of the important policy question now before it. Thank you very much indeed.

Your idea of decentralizing the admissions operation is worth pondering. Of course, much work is done in Lexington as well, with visits and interviews only part of that off-season load. I'm not sure how we could manage a twelve month load out in the field. But we'll think further about it.

Every best wish, Tom.
