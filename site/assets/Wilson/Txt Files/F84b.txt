I want to thank you most sincerely for replying so thoughtfully to my memo on the question of coeducation in the undergraduate program here. Your sense of the matter will be very useful in helping me to my final recommendation to the Board and to the Board's assessment of the important policy question now before it. Thank you very much indeed.

Thank you very much indeed.

I'm distressed to learn about the performance level in your sophomore section. Unattractive though the news may be, it is important we have your comparative framework to contemplate.

Thank you very much, Lyn.
