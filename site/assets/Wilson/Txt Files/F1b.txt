I want to thank you most sincerely for replying so thoughtfully to my memo on the question of coeducation in the undergraduate program here. Your sense of the matter will be very useful in helping me to my final recommendation to the Board and to the Board's assessment of the important policy question now before it. Thank you very much indeed.

Your warning that we ought not use statistics alone, or chiefly, is well made. I too fear a slow debilitating future if enrollment and quality ebb away over the length of a decade. I hope, whatever we do, that we can avoid this kind of erosion.

Thanks, Larry, for all you contribute to this remarkable
place.
