Thanks so much for writing to me on the issue of coeducation. I am especially glad to have your letter before the holiday break for I am going to try to organize the entire file while we are out-of-session for presentation to the Board in February.

I am learning a good deal from my colleagues on this question and on the nature of the University. It is most reassuring to have this chance to ponder the thoughts of colleagues on a matter that concerns us all so closely.

Every best wish.
