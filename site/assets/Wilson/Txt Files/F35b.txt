I want to thank you most sincerely for replying so thoughtfully to my memo on the question of coeducation in the undergraduate program here. Your sense of the matter will be very useful in helping me to my final recommendation to the Board and to the Board's assessment of the important policy question now before it. Thank you very much indeed.

Your most thoughtful assessment of the Davidson experience, past and present, is especially useful. Indeed the entire letter is full of observations of the most valuable kind. I cannot begin to thank you adequately for your masterful summary of the many issues facing us.
