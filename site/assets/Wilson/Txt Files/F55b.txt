Your letter does add to my store of facts and impressions as I knew it would. It is characteristically clear and logical and it states what I have only hinted at--that the main tendency of the society is going in on way and we continue in another. I believe your prediction is accurate, but even if we aren't compelled specifically by the courts by century's end, we will, I think, be made very uncomfortable by what will be universally conceded to be an eccentricity. 

Anyway, I am profoundly grateful and want you to know that I am. I hope the holiday season is good for you and the family. I think my hunter will not be here for much of the time. I'll try to get him out to meet you later on.
