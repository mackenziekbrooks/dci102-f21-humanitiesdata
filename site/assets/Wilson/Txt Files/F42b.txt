Your letter has been received and is warmly welcomed. I know it will prove to be of genuine interest to the members of the Board as it has been, already, to me. I think you managed a new angle of vision on this old subject and I see it a little more clearly now as a consequence.

Thanks so much for taking the time to write. I am grateful beyond saying for the privilege of sharing an association with you.
