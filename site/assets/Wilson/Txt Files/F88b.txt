I want to thank you most sincerely for replying so thoughtfully to my memo on the question of coeducation in the undergraduate program here. Your sense of the matter will be very useful in helping me to my final recommendation to the Board and to the Board's assessment of the important policy question now before it. Thank you very much indeed.

Thanks, John, for making the link between social and academic life. I think we keep these things separate too often, when in fact they tend to feed on each other.

I am grateful to receive your views and to have the chance to share them with the Board.
