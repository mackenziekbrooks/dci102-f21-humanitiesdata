Your letter reached me today, just as I was sorting through the best way to present faculty opinion to the Trustees. I am so happy to have it in time to include it in my presentation. I think it makes some good points in interesting, fresh ways and I know it will be valuable to the Board as it has been to me to read it. 

Every best wish to you and yours in the new year.
