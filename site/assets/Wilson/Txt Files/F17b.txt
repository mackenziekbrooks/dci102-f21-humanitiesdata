I want to thank you most sincerely for replying so thoughtfully to my memo on the question of coeducation in the undergraduate program here. Your sense of the matter will be very useful in helping me to my final recommendation to the Board and to the Board's assessment of the important policy question now before it. Thank you very much indeed.

Your experience of our students' free expression of genial contempt for the serious intentions of women is very much worth having, Harlan. I'm also glad to be reminded of the difficulty in our attempt to attract a Jewish scholar last year. I don't think I realized that coeducation had a part to play in that decision.

Every best wish, Harlan, and thanks so much for your thoughtful letter.
