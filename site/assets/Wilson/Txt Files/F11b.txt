Thank you so much for sharing your thoughts with me on the coeducation issue. I believe your letter and the special perspective it records will prove extremely valuable to the Board and I will make certain that it is read. I hadnâ€˜t thought of this issue at all in terms of the evolving nature of the family in America. You have given me much to ponder over.

I have long contended that our most serious domestic problem is to be found in the dissolution of the family.

W&L's delicate suspension between the everyday world and a monastic, isolation is vitally important to the successful completion of the tasks we set ourselves. Thanks, Uncas, for casting your light upon these corners of our complicated subject.
