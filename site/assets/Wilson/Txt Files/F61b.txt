I want to thank you most sincerely for replying so thoughtfully to my memo on the question of coeducation in the undergraduate program here. Your sense of the matter will be very useful in helping me to my final recommendation to the Board and to the Board's assessment of the important policy question now before it. Thank you very much indeed.

Your perspective is, I think, especially valuable. I share your view that women and men can develop strong feelings of trust and companionship together, or, indeed, apart. But you have directly experienced these things and thus your testimony is especially helpful.

Thanks very much indeed.
